# Memories of Ammayya

From Shiv:

> By all accounts, she was a young beautiful highly sensitive girl with lots of aspirations when she was attending school.
>
> Life treated  her harshly even before she became an adult, which also continued to haunt the rest of her short life. She did have many happy occasions when she had her wonderful six children whom she loved with all her being and was responded in kind by them. 
>She was thrilled to look after her first grandchild  Supriya for a year in India with devoted help from Thara. Also, one of her happiest times was when she spent a year in Winnipeg with Supriya.
>
> I have been a constant companion to her , particularly when our father was away in England. Even at my age of 7, I remember going with her to many Hindi movies  of famous actors like Raj Kapoor, Meena Kumari, Pankaj Mallick and so on. She was adored by her father and she had excellent relationships with two life long friends Baby and Venku Bai. They met often in each other’s houses, even though it involved walking a mile each way. 
>
>She had good relationship with her sister inlaw  and her daughter Komala who lives in Bangalore. She kept her tortured soul mostly to herself as she was a people’s person. When she was in Khatmandu, Nepal and my father gave a dinner party to many Nepalese dignitaries who also looked forward to lots of free wine. My mother made south Indian rasam which was so good no one drank wine. A little later in life, she succumbed to Diabetes which also led to kidney failure. 
>
>I know that if I were a movie maker, the movie about her would be an Oscar winner.


From Papu:

> There is not much to say a mother who raised 6 kids of her own and her siblings in a short span of her life despite the fact that she had personal, health, and financial problems she faced from both sides of the family. Although she went through bad health and a difficult personal life, she ensured that her kids grew in a natural environment. 
>
>She had the charisma to make good friends which kept her occupied, and took us every year to see Dussera and set up some strict guidelines. She attended the yearly Ganesha festival in a grand manner, and she was well known in the community . 
>
>She loved Mama irrespective of his other problems, and Mama also showed his love during last years of her life taking her around Nepal, UK , Canada and USA.
>
>Also I have to thank Thara who took the responsibility to raise attest three of us when Ammaya was sick. 
>And thanks to all of you for sticking to Amaya’s  principles. She said once, all her children were equal. She said this when Indian parents always looking at favouring their sons.
>
>I have gone with mother when I was 8 year old to all places in Karnataka with Bhava and Sharada .
>
>Even today Ammaya and Mama inspire me, as I spent 20-plus years of my life with her and Mama.
>I just want to think of good years she had in her lifetime.
>
>That’s all I can say, the rest is well known of her charisma, and helping people when they were in need.

From: Thara 
>
>We all did massage to her legs, 1/2 an hr to 1hr.( that was too much for me )
>She was very smart in recognizing and quick in responding to emergencies, such as when Appa had a heart attack, she immediately called ambulance.( I still remember the day it happened)
> I also remember when she broke her leg in the bathroom. We were in the house at Old Veterinary Hospital Road. The bathroom was outside, and she may have been dizzy due to having daibetes, but one morning around 7.30am,   she missed her step in the bathroom.
>
>One amazing thing, Ammaya kept in touch with childhood friends till her last days. Of course we also enjoyed their company. The greatest thing, she loved her parents also very much & helped them when they needed. Ammaya never got angry at anytime. I do not remember, during my 29 years of staying with her under the same roof, she did not complain not even once. 

From: Papi 
>
>It gives me immense pleasure to write a few words on our Mother, a guide and a mentor.  I was also very close like all other siblings, a great lady with a soft heart and great mind and would do anything to see her children grow up well.  Often she used to teach me my school lessons and many times accompanied me to school specially on the valedictory day where I was receiving prizes for various competitions. She was a proud mother and her eyes expressed satisfaction and happiness of seeing her daughter getting prizes at school.
>I used to be a right hand to her helping in her daily chores and specially after she fell sick.  I have also had my share of massaging her leg.  She used to express her happiness and pleasure when I used to wear her jewelry. 
>I am a theist like her who believed in the existence of God.   
>When one day, after my marriage was fixed, I was crying with tears in my eyes on the very thought that parents had to spend a lot of money on my marriage.  She gave me courage and convinced me that everything will be taken care off.
>
> With all the bad health, she was the same affectionate and loved mother.   She used to forget her pain saying that she had the best children.   Shiv Anna was her favorite and when he left for England tears rolled down her eyes for days.
>She refused to send me to England because she wanted me to get married in India although father had made arrangements to stay with his friends family.
>She was a great mother and what I am today , I attribute to her guidance.

From: Sada
>
>It is a very long story compared to the others of Ammayya's children. I was very close to Ammaya, ask me what do I mean close , which is I used to accompany her to her friend Venkubaye while going from home and also  bring her back from her friend's house walking holding my cycle. 
>Secondly many of friends used to come home and she would tell me bring Masala DOSA from Vidyarthi Bhavan in Gandhi Bazar. 
>Thirdly, I used to accompany and sit with her in Varanada as she was waiting for mama to come home. 
>Fourth, I used to massage her leg and shoulder always because she used to get pain. 
>Fifth,  I was   doing shopping for her on my cycle. 
>Supplying spare parts for state transport, I used to take care of her hospital expenses and one day she expired during that I was not near by in hospital, I took her body in my friends car to home , informed death to many friends and relatives and later she was cremated. I could not bear the cremation scene and cried. Father also did lot of things for mother by staying 24 hours with her in hospital. This is my real story with mother and I regret that I was studying and wasn't able to help when she broke her leg.
