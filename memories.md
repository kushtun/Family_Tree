i# Memories of Ammayya

From Shiv:

> By all accounts, she was a young beautiful highly sensitive girl with lots of aspirations when she was attending school.
>
> Life treated  her harshly even before she became an adult, which also continued to haunt the rest of her short life. She did have many happy occasions when she had her wonderful six children whom she loved with all her being and was responded in kind by them. 
>She was thrilled to look after her first grandchild  Supriya for a year in India with devoted help from Thara. Also, one of her happiest times was when she spent a year in Winnipeg with Supriya.
>
> I have been a constant companion to her , particularly when our father was away in England. Even at my age of 7, I remember going with her to many Hindi movies  of famous actors like Raj Kapoor, Meena Kumari, Pankaj Mallick and so on. She was adored by her father and she had excellent relationships with two life long friends Baby and Venku Bai. They met often in each other’s houses, even though it involved walking a mile each way. 
>
>She had good relationship with her sister inlaw  and her daughter Komala who lives in Bangalore. She kept her tortured soul mostly to herself as she was a people’s person. When she was in Khatmandu, Nepal and my father gave a dinner party to many Nepalese dignitaries who also looked forward to lots of free wine. My mother made south Indian rasam which was so good no one drank wine. A little later in life, she succumbed to Diabetes which also led to kidney failure. 
>
>I know that if I were a movie maker, the movie about her would be an Oscar winner.


From Papu:

> There is not much to say a mother who raised 6 kids of her own and her siblings in a short span of her life despite the fact that she had personal, health, and financial problems she faced from both sides of the family. Although she went through bad health and a difficult personal life, she ensured that her kids grew in a natural environment. 
>
>She had the charisma to make good friends which kept her occupied, and took us every year to see Dussera and set up some strict guidelines. She attended the yearly Ganesha festival in a grand manner, and she was well known in the community . 
>
>She loved Mama irrespective of his other problems, and Mama also showed his love during last years of her life taking her around Nepal, UK , Canada and USA.
>
>Also I have to thank Thara who took the responsibility to raise attest three of us when Ammaya was sick. 
>And thanks to all of you for sticking to Amaya’s  principles. She said once, all her children were equal. She said this when Indian parents always looking at favouring their sons.
>
>I have gone with mother when I was 8 year old to all places in Karnataka with Bhava and Sharada .
>
>Even today Ammaya and Mama inspire me, as I spent 20-plus years of my life with her and Mama.
>I just want to think of good years she had in her lifetime.
>
>That’s all I can say, the rest is well known of her charisma, and helping people when they were in need.
